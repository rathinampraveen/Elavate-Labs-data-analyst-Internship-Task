## Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine
 Project Objective
Analyze historical Airbnb data to recommend optimal listing prices based on factors like location, seasonality, and listing quality.
The goal is to empower Airbnb hosts to dynamically adjust their prices using data-driven insights.

 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Plotly)

Tableau (Dashboard for visual analytics)

Excel (Initial data exploration and cleaning)

Google Colab (Python coding environment)

Steps Involved
Data Collection:

Gathered historical Airbnb listing data including city, property type, number of reviews, ratings, and prices.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, formatted fields, removed pricing outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Studied price distributions across different cities and property types.

Analyzed correlation between review scores and prices.

Model Building:

Developed a Linear Regression model to predict optimal listing prices based on features like review scores, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Visualization:

Created dynamic visualizations using Plotly (Python) and a Tableau dashboard with city filters and price sliders.

Recommendations:

Based on model results, recommended strategies for pricing adjustment based on listing quality and location.

 Deliverables
Python scripts for data analysis and modeling.

CSV file with predicted prices (airbnb_pricing_for_tableau.csv).

Tableau dashboard with filters for city, property type, and price sliders.
